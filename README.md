# Arma 3 CFG Editor

*Validate your config files without loading up Arma!*

A simple web app using an embedded ace editor sitting on my pure Javascript CFG parser. I personally use it for managing my server config files and light Cfg's for mods. Does not support preprocessor commands or includes as well as no detection for class inheritance.

## Usage
Simply clone the repository then navigate to the folder and open `index.html`.
